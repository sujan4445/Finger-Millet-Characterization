This repository contains an R script designed to generate high-quality publication-ready pie charts using ggplot2, dplyr, patchwork, and showtext.
The script reads trait-wise frequency data from a dataset (referred to as Graph) and produces custom-styled pie charts, arranged neatly in rows or grids.
